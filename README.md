# D-Blur: Diffusion Coefficient Prediction from Single PSFs

D-Blur is a deep learning framework that extracts diffusion coefficients directly from single-molecule point spread functions (PSFs) in single-molecule microscopy.

This approach allows accurate estimation of molecular dynamics from blurred images using a U-Net-based architecture.
